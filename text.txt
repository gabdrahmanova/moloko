This Advanced Planar Stripe HEXFET ® Power MOSFET utilizes
the latest processing techniques to achieve extremely low on-
resistance per silicon area. Additional features of this HEXFET
power MOSFET are a 175°C junction operating temperature, low
RθJC, fast switching speed and improved repetitive avalanche
rating. This combination makes the design an extremely efficient
and reliable choice for use in a wide variety of applications.
